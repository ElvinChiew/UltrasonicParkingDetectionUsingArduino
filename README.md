# UltrasonicParkingDetectionUsingArduino
This is my FYP project.
It is a parking detection system using arduino and ultrasonic sensor.

A simple prototype mobile application is also developed using MIT app inventor.

The aim of the project is to provide the user information of the availability of the parking spaces in DKP baru area.

Using ultrasonic sensor, the state of parking space is determined if it is 'occupied' or 'vacant'.
The state then stored into a firebase database.
The infomation about the availability then be displayed in the mobile apps in real time.
